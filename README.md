# Pytorch-Basics
Basic implementation of feedforward neural network and convolutional neural network with Pytorch
An extension of last project where I switched from just numpy to learning how to use the Pytorch library. Also created a drawing file where users can draw a number and the convolutional neural network will ouput its guess.
